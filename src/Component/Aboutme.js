            <h4>23 years  / React Developer / Freelance </h4>
            <p>I was born in 1976. I live in Bavaria and work in Munich as a Software Developer/Architect.
                I’ve been a professional developer for more than 15 years.
                I’ve mostly worked professionally with Java, C, C++ and Python but also a little
                 bit with Ruby, Perl and PHP. I’ve published more than 20 articles for German 
                 programming magazines, mostly about Ruby and Python but also C++ and Java.</p>
